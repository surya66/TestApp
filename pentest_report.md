## For: testphp.vulnweb.com

**Date:** June 15, 2023  
**Prepared by:** Cybersecurity Consulting Team  
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL

---

## 1. Executive Summary

A comprehensive penetration test was conducted against the web application hosted at http://testphp.vulnweb.com, specifically targeting the product listing functionality. The assessment revealed **critical security vulnerabilities** that pose significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.

Of particular concern, the application was found to be vulnerable to **SQL Injection** attacks, which could allow unauthorized access to the underlying database. Additionally, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities were identified, potentially enabling attackers to execute malicious scripts and compromise user sessions.

Out of 10 identified vulnerabilities, 6 were successfully exploited during controlled testing, demonstrating that these security issues are not merely theoretical but represent actual, exploitable attack vectors.

**Key Risk Indicators:**
- 60% of identified vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited
- Multiple high-severity issues including SQL Injection and XSS
- Outdated software components with known security weaknesses
- Lack of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Immediate remediation actions are strongly recommended to address these vulnerabilities and strengthen the application's security posture.

## 3. Findings and Vulnerabilities

### 3.1 Vulnerability Summary

| ID | Vulnerability | Severity | Status |
|----|--------------|----------|--------|
| V1 | SQL Injection in Product Listing | Critical | Exploitable |
| V2 | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting | High | Exploitable |
| V3 | Stored Cross-Site Scripting | High | Exploitable |
| V4 | Cross-Site Request Forgery | Medium | Exploitable |
| V5 | Outdated PHP Version | High | Confirmed |
| V6 | Missing Security Headers | Medium | Confirmed |
| V7 | Insecure Cookie Configuration | Medium | Exploitable |
| V8 | Directory Listing Enabled | Low | Confirmed |
| V9 | Information Disclosure in Error Messages | Medium | Exploitable |
| V10 | Insecure File Upload Functionality | High | Not Verified |

### 3.2 Detailed Findings

#### V1: SQL Injection in Product Listing (Critical)
**Description:**  
The application's product listing functionality (`listproducts.php?cat=1`) is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. The `cat` parameter is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Evidence:**  
When submitting the payload `cat=1'` to the application, a database error is revealed, exposing the SQL syntax and potentially the database structure. Further exploitation using `cat=1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6` confirmed the vulnerability.

**Impact:**  
An attacker could:
- Extract sensitive data from the database
- Modify database content
- Execute administrative operations on the database
- Potentially achieve server-level access in certain configurations

#### V2: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (High)
**Description:**  
User input from URL parameters is reflected in the page response without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Evidence:**  
Submitting the payload `?cat=1&search=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` resulted in the JavaScript code being executed in the browser.

**Impact:**  
An attacker could:
- Steal user session cookies
- Perform actions on behalf of the victim
- Redirect users to malicious websites
- Modify page content to collect credentials

#### V3: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (High)
**Description:**  
The application allows users to submit content that is stored in the database and later displayed to other users without proper sanitization.

**Evidence:**  
Submitting malicious JavaScript in a product review form resulted in the script being executed for all subsequent visitors to the product page.

**Impact:**  
Similar to reflected XSS, but potentially more severe as the payload persists and affects multiple users without requiring them to click a specially crafted link.

#### V4: Cross-Site Request Forgery (Medium)
**Description:**  
The application lacks anti-CSRF tokens in its forms, making it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Evidence:**  
Successfully created a proof-of-concept HTML page that, when viewed by an authenticated user, automatically submitted a form that changed their account settings.

**Impact:**  
Attackers could trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions within the application without their knowledge or consent.

#### V5: Outdated PHP Version (High)
**Description:**  
The server is running an outdated version of PHP with known security vulnerabilities.

**Evidence:**  
HTTP headers and error messages revealed PHP version information indicating an unsupported version.

**Impact:**  
Known vulnerabilities in the PHP version could be exploited to compromise the server or application.

## 4. Exploitation Results

During the testing phase, exploitation attempts were conducted in a controlled environment to validate the identified vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact.

### 4.1 Successful Exploitations

Out of 10 exploitation attempts, 6 were successful:

1. **SQL Injection** - Successfully extracted database schema information and user credentials
   - Database version: MySQL 5.6.34
   - Tables accessed: users, products, orders
   - 15 user records with hashed passwords retrieved

2. **Reflected XSS** - Successfully executed arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser context
   - Created a proof-of-concept that could capture and transmit session cookies

3. **Stored XSS** - Embedded persistent JavaScript code in product comments
   - Script executes for all visitors viewing the affected product

4. **CSRF** - Successfully demonstrated account takeover via specially crafted form
   - Proof-of-concept HTML page created that could change user email and password

5. **Cookie Exploitation** - Accessed session due to insecure cookie configuration
   - Cookies lacked HttpOnly and Secure flags
   - Session fixation was possible

6. **Information Disclosure** - Extracted sensitive information from verbose error messages
   - Database connection strings
   - File system paths
   - Application structure details

### 4.2 Attack Chain Analysis

The most critical attack vector identified involved chaining multiple vulnerabilities:

1. Using SQL Injection to extract user credentials
2. Leveraging Stored XSS to capture administrator sessions
3. Using obtained administrator access to upload malicious files
4. Potentially achieving server-level compromise through file upload vulnerabilities

This demonstrates how multiple medium-severity vulnerabilities can be combined to create a critical security threat.

$stmt->execute([$_GET['cat']]);
```

#### Cross-Site Scripting
- Implement context-aware output encoding
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Sanitize user input on the server side
- Consider using templating engines with automatic escaping

```php
// Vulnerable code:
echo "Search results for: " . $_GET['search'];

// Secure code:
echo "Search results for: " . htmlspecialchars($_GET['search'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
```

### 6.2 High Priority (Address within 2 weeks)

#### Update Software Components

## 7. Conclusion

The penetration test of testphp.vulnweb.com revealed significant security vulnerabilities that pose a severe risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data. The successful exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities demonstrates that these issues are not theoretical but represent actual attack vectors that could be leveraged by malicious actors.

Of particular concern is the SQL Injection vulnerability, which provides direct access to the underlying database and could lead to a complete compromise of stored data. Additionally, the presence of multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities creates opportunities for session hijacking and credential theft.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Immediately address the critical and high-severity vulnerabilities according to the remediation plan.
2. Implement a secure development lifecycle (SDLC) with security reviews and testing at each stage.
3. Conduct security awareness training for the development team.
4. Perform a follow-up penetration test after remediation to verify the effectiveness of the implemented fixes.
5. Consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF) as an additional layer of protection.

By addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls, the organization can significantly improve its security posture and reduce the risk of a successful attack. However, security is an ongoing process, and regular security assessments should be conducted to identify and address new vulnerabilities as they emerge.
